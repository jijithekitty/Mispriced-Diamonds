# Mispriced Diamonds
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Investigated the relationship between price and average clarity of a diamond by visualizing the dataset.

</table>

## Problem
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Does better clarity always mean that the diamond is always going to be priced high?
Does that relationship sometimes not hold true indicating that there are mispricings in the market?
</td>
</tr>

## Data


## Conclusion
<table>
<tr>
<td>
As we move towards the right, the confidence bounds are getting greater meaning that there's less
confidence about what's going on in the data. Observing the plot, there are intersections between the
lines meaning there is mispricing.
